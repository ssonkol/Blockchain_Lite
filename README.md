# Blockchain_Lite

With the current news of multple celebrities and regular people investing in the likes of Dodge, Bitcoin or Etherium, I thought it was about time I started to understand what was really going on.

So I decided to understand and build my own blockchain... because what's better than building your own Blockchain... who knows... this might take off!

## Introduction
This will be my first attempt at developing a blockchain system accompanied by an interactable site where I can mine and view the amount of coins I have accumulated.
I'm hoping clean code and regular documentationn will make up for this.
